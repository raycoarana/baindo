Baindo is a library that let you implement the MVVM (Model View View-Model) pattern in a very simple and
efficient way. Contrary to other frameworks, Baindo is built with performance in mind, so it doesn't use any
kind of reflection. Bind your views and adapters with Baindo to your ViewModels and keep them away from any
dependency with you UI.

Baindo uses Universal Image Loader to bind images to ImageViews and Pedro Gome'z Renderers library as a base
to build the binders to adapters.
